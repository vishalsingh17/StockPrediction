# StockPrediction
Machine learning has significant applications in the stock price prediction. In this machine learning project, we will be talking about predicting the returns on stocks. This is a very complex task and has uncertainties. We will develop this project into two parts:

First, we will learn how to predict stock price using the LSTM neural network.
Then we will build a dashboard using Plotly dash for stock analysis.
